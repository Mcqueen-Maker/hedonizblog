                    <p>There's something irresistible about the Canadian Rockies: pristine lakes that look unreal, waterfalls that roar, wildlife at every turn, and a road trip through landscapes that feel like they belong in a dream. Our summer 2025 adventure took us from Toronto to Calgary, then into the heart of the Rockies — and here's how it unfolded.</p>

                    <h2>🗓️ Day 1 — Arrival: Calgary → Canmore → Banff</h2>
                    <p>We landed at Toronto Pearson Airport, flew into Calgary, and picked up our rental car — with built-in GPS (pro tip: you'll need it once cell service disappears). After a scenic ~2-hour drive we reached Canmore, our home base for the next few days.</p>
                    <p>That afternoon we drove into Banff town:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Brunch at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mumbailocalcanmore/?hl=en" target="_blank">Mumbai Local Canmore</a></li>
                        <li>Walked along the Bow River</li>
                        <li>Strolled through Cascade Gardens — alpine flowers and playful ground squirrels made it worth the stop.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Evening was simple: unwind at our <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/46139983?source_impression_id=p3_1769620897_P3QhBJSNSM16cxoY" target="_blank">Airbnb (A room with a view)</a>, hit the sauna, and watch the stars light up the Rockies.</p>

                    <h2>🗓️ Day 2 — Yoho National Park: Emerald Lake + Takakkaw Falls</h2>
                    <p>Yoho is less crowded than Banff, but every bit as beautiful.</p>
                    <figure class="post-image">
                        <img src="images/canadian-rockies-trip/emeraldlake-shutterbae.jpg" alt="Emerald Lake in Yoho National Park" />
                        <figcaption>Emerald Lake's crystal-clear waters reflecting the surrounding peaks</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Emerald Lake was my favorite stop on the whole trip — calm, blue-green water, reflections of peaks, and that peaceful vibe you hope for on a mountain getaway. We took a boat ride here, but be ready for crowds: peak season parking fills fast.</p>
                    <p>Next up, Takakkaw Falls — one of the tallest waterfalls in Canada. The spray cools your face even on warm summer afternoons.</p>
                    <figure class="post-image">
                        <img src="images/canadian-rockies-trip/takawwafalls-shutterbae.jpg" alt="Takakkaw Falls" />
                        <figcaption>The powerful Takakkaw Falls in Yoho National Park</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Did you notice? In this region Parks Canada has invested in wildlife crossings — bridges and underpasses that help animals traverse highways safely without interacting with cars. This kind of engineering is especially visible around Banff and the main parkways.</p>

                    <h2>🗓️ Day 3 — Moraine Lake Sunrise + Sentinel Pass Hike + Lake Louise</h2>
                    <p>We booked an early <a href="https://tenpeaksshuttle.ca/lake-louise-trip/sunrise/" target="_blank">shuttle for sunrise at Moraine Lake</a> — these sell out quickly in summer and are well worth it for the light on the peaks.</p>
                    <p>Next we joined a hiking group to tackle Sentinel Pass via Larch Valley:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>~11.5 km round trip</li>
                        <li>~762 m elevation gain</li>
                        <li>5–6 hours total</li>
                    </ul>
                    <figure class="post-image">
                        <img src="images/canadian-rockies-trip/larchvalley-shutterbae.jpg" alt="Larch Valley trail" />
                        <figcaption>The beautiful Larch Valley trail leading to Sentinel Pass</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <figure class="post-image">

                        <figcaption>The golden larches and mountain views in Larch Valley</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>The upper trail is steep and breathtaking — views of the Valley of the Ten Peaks feel like stepping into another world.</p>
                    <figure class="post-image">
                        <img src="images/canadian-rockies-trip/sentinelpass-shutterbae.jpg" alt="Sentinel Pass viewpoint" />
                        <figcaption>Reaching the summit of Sentinel Pass with panoramic views</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>We tried to squeeze in Lake Louise afterward, but the crowds were overwhelming — a reminder that some spectacular places are also the busiest. We took the local bus back and headed for dinner and rest.</p>

                    <h2>🗓️ Day 4 — Icefields Parkway to Jasper (The Major Drive)</h2>
                    <figure class="post-image">
                        <img src="images/canadian-rockies-trip/IMG_4461-shutterbae.jpg" alt="Icefields Parkway scenery" />
                        <figcaption>The breathtaking Icefields Parkway connecting Banff to Jasper</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>This was the full-day highlight: Icefields Parkway. Often ranked as one of the most scenic drives in the world, this ~232 km stretch from Banff to Jasper pulls you through glaciers, lakes, waterfalls and valleys.</p>
                    <p>We stopped at many viewpoints:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Vermillion Lakes</li>
                        <li>Peyto Lake</li>
                        <li>Bow Lake</li>
                        <li>Sunwapta Falls</li>
                        <li>Pyramid Lake</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Plan to pack snacks and fill your tank early — services are sparse, and cell coverage is nonexistent for long sections. The <a href="https://www.banfflakelouise.com/explore-the-park/transit-shuttles" target="_blank">shuttle service is very convenient</a> for exploring without the stress of driving, and we learned it was definitely something we'd rely on more for our second trip.</p>
                    <p>We also used a <a href="https://www.banffjaspercollection.com/attractions/pursuit-pass/" target="_blank">Pursuit Pass</a> that included glacier access and the <a href="https://www.banffjaspercollection.com/canadian-rockies/golden/" target="_blank">Skybridge experience</a> — walking out over a canyon with glass beneath your feet is unforgettable.</p>
                    <p>Jasper greeted us with burned forests from recent wildfires — sad to see, but even charred trees added a stark beauty to the landscape.</p>

                    <h2>🗓️ Day 5 — Rainy Day & Wildlife Tour in Jasper</h2>
                    <p>The weather turned on us, so this day was low-key:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Strolled Jasper Downtown</li>
                        <li>Visited a local community garden</li>
                        <li>Drove to Athabasca Falls (the force of the water is amazing)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <figure class="post-image">

                        <figcaption>The charming downtown area of Jasper</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>In the evening, we booked a wildlife tour. We spotted:</p>
                    <figure class="post-image">

                        <figcaption>Spotting wildlife like mountain goats and elk in Jasper National Park</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mountain goats</li>
                        <li>Bald eagles</li>
                        <li>Hoary marmots</li>
                        <li>Elk</li>
                        <li>Wolves</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>… but no grizzlies this time.</p>

                    <h2>🗓️ Day 6 — Maligne Lake & Spirit Island Cruise</h2>
                    <p>Maligne Lake was pure magic. The cruise to Spirit Island was included with our adventure pass, and the quiet on the water is something no photo can truly capture — it must be experienced.</p>
                    <p>Spirit Island also holds cultural significance for local Indigenous groups, who see it as a spiritual place in their traditions (I'll add those details for context in the final blog).</p>
                    <p>On the way back, we were lucky enough to see a black bear with two cubs, slow and respectful viewing rule: don't block the road, keep moving slowly, and let traffic pass.</p>
                    <p>We stayed at Jasper Inn & Spa — excellent hot pools and sauna to unwind.</p>

                    <h2>🗓️ Day 7 — Yoho National Park: Golden Skybridge</h2>
                    <p>Back toward Banff we visited Golden Skybridge, an adventure park built around suspension bridges, activities and forest views. Perfect for a fun, active day — especially if traveling with family.</p>

                    <h2>🗓️ Day 8 — Back in Banff: HI Banff Alpine Centre</h2>
                    <p>We wrapped up our Rockies journey in Banff at the cozy HI Banff Alpine Centre. It was one of the most budget-friendly and comfortable stays — clean, social, and well-located.</p>

                    <h2>🗓️ Bonus: Kananaskis Country & Bear Sightings</h2>
                    <p>A quick drive to Kananaskis Country finally delivered grizzly sightings: four bears munching on berries within about 20 minutes — a perfect ending to an unforgettable week.</p>

                    <h2>🗒️ Practical Tips for Future Travelers</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Getting around:</strong> GPS or offline maps are essential — much of the Icefields Parkway has no mobile coverage.</li>
                        <li><strong>Parking + crowds:</strong> Peak season means pre-book shuttles at Moraine and plan early starts.</li>
                        <li><strong>Wildlife etiquette:</strong> Stay in your car, slow down, and don't block roads when animals appear.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>🎓 Fun Facts I Learned on the Trip</h2>
                    <h3>Banff's Wildlife Crossings</h3>
                    <p>The park features one of the world's most extensive wildlife crossing systems — 44 main structures (6 overpasses + 38 underpasses), drastically reducing animal–vehicle collisions.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Takakkaw Falls</h3>
                    <p>Canada's second-tallest waterfall at ~373 m / 1,224 ft, fed by Daly Glacier — its name comes from a Cree word meaning "magnificent."</p>
                    
                    <h3>Ground Squirrels in Alberta</h3>
                    <p>They thrive on the ground — better insulation from winter cold than tree dwellers.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Ice Explorer Facts</h3>
                    <p>These are huge, specialized vehicles built to traverse glacier ice, with massive low-pressure tires and the ability to carry passengers safely onto the glacier.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Elk vs Grizzly</h3>
                    <p>According to guides, elk can actually be more dangerous than grizzlies during rut due to intense hormone activity — always keep your distance.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Antlers & Horns</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Elk antlers can weigh 10–30 lbs (sometimes up to 40–50)</li>
                        <li>Bighorn sheep horns can weigh ~30 lbs — sometimes 10% of their body mass</li>
                        <li>Mountain goat horns are lighter (~5–6 lbs)</li>
                        <li>Elk antlers shed yearly; age is best estimated by configuration, not rings</li>
                        <li>Sheep and goats show growth rings in their horns — similar to tree rings</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Water's Blue Hue</h3>
                    <p>All glacier-fed lakes get that unreal turquoise from rock flour — fine sediment pulverized by moving ice.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Spirit Island's Significance</h3>
                    <p>It's a sacred place for the Stoney Nakoda, surrounded on three sides by mountains — a rare natural formation.</p>

                    <h2>🧠 Final Thoughts</h2>
                    <p>Banff and Jasper are both breathtaking, but they're very different vibes. Banff is more developed and busy; Jasper feels more wild and peaceful. If you're planning a trip here, give yourself plenty of time — these parks deserve it.</p>
