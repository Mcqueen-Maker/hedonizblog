                <div class="post-content">
                    <p>Some days I want to eat well.</p>
                    <p>Some days I want protein.</p>
                    <p>Most days, I don't want to think too hard.</p>
                    <p>This recipe was born on one of those days.</p>
                    <p>I wanted something easy, something that used up the vegetables sitting in my fridge, something that felt nourishing without feeling like punishment. And also — very important — something that actually tasted good.</p>
                    <p>Enter: this veggie-and-egg bake.</p>
                    <p>It's colorful, filling, packed with vegetables and protein, and quietly comforting in a way that makes you feel like you've made a good life choice.</p>

                    </figure>

                    <h2>First, the vegetables (there are a lot of them)</h2>
                    <p>I don't measure obsessively, but for 6 eggs, I usually aim for at least 3 cups of chopped vegetables. Sometimes more. More is good.</p>
                    <p><strong>My regular lineup:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Broccoli</li>
                        <li>Carrots</li>
                        <li>Red bell pepper</li>
                        <li>Mushrooms (and yes, I mean a lot of mushrooms)</li>
                        <li>Zucchini</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This part is flexible. Very flexible.</p>
                    <p>If your fridge looks different, that's fine. This recipe is forgiving.</p>
                    <p><strong>For herbs, I usually grab:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Scallions</li>
                        <li>Coriander (cilantro)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>But I've also used rosemary, thyme, or whatever survived the week. No rules here.</p>

                    <h2>The quick sauté situation</h2>
                    <p>I heat a pan, add a little oil, and sauté the vegetables just until they soften slightly.</p>
                    <p>Not mushy. Still crunchy. They're going into the oven later — they don't need to be fully cooked yet.</p>
                    <p>I salt them, add a little paprika (because why not), give everything a stir, and call it done.</p>
                    <p>Set them aside. Don't overthink it.</p>

                    <h2>The egg part (very low effort)</h2>
                    <p><strong>In a bowl:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Crack 6 eggs</li>
                        <li>Add ½ cup milk or buttermilk</li>
                        <li>Whisk it with a fork until it looks slightly frothy — nothing fancy.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Then:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Add salt</li>
                        <li>Add mozzarella cheese</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This recipe would be incomplete without cheese. Let's be honest.</p>

                    <h2>Bringing it all together</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F.</li>
                        <li>Take a baking dish and oil the sides. Future-you will thank present-you for this.</li>
                        <li>Spread the vegetables evenly in the dish.</li>
                        <li>Pour the egg mixture over them.</li>
                        <li>Give the dish a gentle shake so everything settles where it wants to be.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>That's it. That's the whole assembly process.</p>

                    <h2>Bake & wait</h2>
                    <p>Slide it into the oven for 30–40 minutes.</p>
                    <p>At around 30 minutes, I check with a fork. If it comes out mostly clean, you're good. If not, give it a few more minutes.</p>
                    <p>Let it rest for a bit before cutting into it. It's worth the wait.</p>

                    <h2>How I usually eat it</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sometimes with toast.</li>
                        <li>Sometimes straight from the dish.</li>
                        <li>Sometimes cold the next day, standing in the kitchen.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>It works every time.</p>

                    <h2>A few gentle reminders</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>This is packed with vegetables</strong> → fiber, micronutrients, amino acids</li>
                        <li><strong>Eggs bring the protein</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Cheese brings happiness</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>And somehow, all of it comes together into something that feels comforting and wholesome at the same time.</p>

                    <h2>🧠 Why This Recipe Works</h2>
                    <p>There's something deeply satisfying about a one-dish meal that's good for you. No elaborate technique. No fancy ingredients. Just honest food that nourishes and tastes like care.</p>
                    <p>Whether you're cooking for yourself or feeding someone else, this bake says: <em>I took time to make something good.</em></p>
